## üéØ HOW THE CHATBOT WORKS

### Architecture:
```
User types message
    ‚Üì
Frontend sends to: POST /api/chatbot/message
    ‚Üì
Backend checks JWT authentication
    ‚Üì
Try OpenAI API (with your new key)
    ‚Üì
If OpenAI fails ‚Üí Intelligent Fallback System
    ‚Üì
Pattern matching on user message
    ‚Üì
Generate empathetic ADHD-specific response
    ‚Üì
Return response + contextual suggestions
```
