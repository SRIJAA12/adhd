// Medium urgency: "Hi there! [task] is getting closer to its deadline."
// High urgency: "Hey, [task] needs attention soon! Let's tackle it together."
```

#### Time-Aware Messages:
- **Task Started**: "Perfect! Let's work on [task] together. You have 25 minutes..."
- **Task Overdue**: "[Task] is now 2 hours overdue. But hey, that's okay! ADHD time can be tricky."
- **Multiple Urgent**: "You have 3 tasks that need attention soon. Let's prioritize together."

### 3. **Real-Time Mood Updates**
- Avatar mood updates every second based on current task states

## 🔄 Real-Time Integration Flow

### 1. **Task Creation**:
```
User creates task → Avatar says "Perfect! Let's work on [task] together..."
→ Mood changes to 'encouraging' → Timer starts if requested
```

### 2. **Task Progress Monitoring**:
```
Every second → Check all task deadlines → Calculate urgency levels
→ Update avatar mood → Send notifications if needed
```

### 3. **Task Completion**:
```
User completes task → Avatar celebrates → Mood changes to 'celebrating'
→ Stop active timer → Update overall urgency assessment
```

### 4. **Overdue Detection**:
